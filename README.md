# ReClearLooks-openbox

This is a openbox theme which is mostly based in the current **clearlooks-olive** and **clearlooks** openbox themes.

It also has elements taken from the **Lubuntu-Arc** theme for openbox, and **Onyx** openbox theme.

It basically consists in the addition of the hovering effect when mouse is over the buttons (showing in the gif below) and the indicator of red color, which tells you that the window is maximized (also in the .gif)

It also comes with pressing button effects, which are shown together with the 'inactive-window' effect, in the following .gif:

For the orange theme, you can see the colors and the same effects in this one:

A lot of different color schemes can be made, for the moment i only have used those two, maybe i will add more in the future.

## How to Use:

Copy the ReClearLooks-Olive and the ReClearlooks-Orange folders inside:

```
~/.themes

```
Or, with absolute path:

```
/home/YOUR_USER/.themes
```

Open your 'Opebox Settings program' and select the desired theme.
